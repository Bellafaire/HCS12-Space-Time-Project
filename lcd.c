 * Durham College, Oshawa ON
 *
 * Based on Dragon12 documentation and Lcd.asm example
 * by Wayne Chu, EVBPLUS.COM/Wytec Co
 * http://www.evbplus.com/
 *
 * Compile with EmbeddedGNU/gcc-m68hc12, 
 * Dragon12 hardware profile
 *
 * LCD Module is in 4-bit mode.
 * Port K bit assignment:
 *   7 = unused
 *   6 = unused
 *   5 = Module DB7
 *   4 = Module DB6
 *   3 = Module DB5
 *   2 = Module DB4
 *   1 = EN (pulse 1 to write)
 *   0 = RS (0=command, 1=data)
